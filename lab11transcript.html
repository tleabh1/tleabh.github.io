        Hello everybody

An album that I would like to talk about today is WORLDS by PORTER ROBINSON.

Porter Robinson is a prominent American electronic producer from the Chapel Hill, North Carolina area.

His album, Worlds, was released on August 12, 2014, as a way of  an escape from reality. The tune that’s playing in

the background is a song off from the Album called Sad Machine. 


Although it can seem a bit dark at times, this album has had a far deeper impact on me

than any album I’ve ever listened to. What makes this album quite special is the live show experience.

Porter Robinson toured Worlds from 2014-2018 selling out venues all over the world. I finally

got the chance in 2016 to see the live show and I was completely blown away. I definitely would recommend

Worlds to anyone who is interested in experimental, electronic music and is open to escaping from reality.
